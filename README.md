# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Assisting Louise in determining what her goals and chance of success will be for her theater kickstarter
---
During my analysis I found that: 
--- 
	- Parent category theater kickstarters that set their goals around $5K were more likely to be successful than parent category theater kickstarters that had goals of $10K or higher
	- Parent category theater kickstarters that also had an avg. goal of around $5K such substanitally higher pledge amounts than those parent category theater kickstarters that failed with an avg. goal of $10K
	
	- Additionally, the subcategory of "plays" under parent category "theater" were the most successful subcategory of all subcategories

	- Of the parent category theater kickstarters that had success, most started in May, followed by June and July

Therefore it is my recommendation based on my findings that Louise should start her kickstarter in the months of May, June, or July, and the goal should be around $5K
